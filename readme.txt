Provides enhanced version of BuddyPress's core Groups and Members widgets

== Description ==

This plugin adds two widgets to your WordPress MU/BuddyPress installation: Groups and Members. Use them instead of the Groups and Members widgets that ship with BuddyPress. They provide the ability to select which of the three tabs - Newest, Active, or Popular - will be the widget's default view.
