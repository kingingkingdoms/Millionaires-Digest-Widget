Provides enhanced version of BuddyPress's core Groups and Members widgets

== Description ==

This plugin adds two widgets to your WordPress MU/BuddyPress installation: Groups and Members. Use them instead of the Groups and Members widgets that ship with BuddyPress. They provide the ability to select which of the three tabs - Newest, Active, or Popular - will be the widget's default view.

Version 0.2 of this plugin works only with BuddyPress 1.2. For earlier versions of BuddyPress, please download version 0.1 of the plugin.
